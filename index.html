					Hello World!
					<br><br>
					My name is Jay, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.
					<br><br>
					I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area (Santa Clara, Cupertino, and San Ramon) and was surrounded by large technology companies my entire life. Determined to get a better understanding of the framework that drove these companies, I decided to sign up for an introductory college computer science class at San Jose State University when I was 16. After getting exposed to the abstract yet beautiful world of problem solving defined through Computer Science, I was hooked. 
					<br><br>
					I've been programming ever since, and even though there are times when I get flustered due to annoying bugs, I think that incrementally creating something useful out of nothing is truly a surreal experience.
					<br><br>
					In my free time, I really like to exercise (tennis, table tennis, and weights), catch up on TV shows (current favorites are Friends, The Office, House of Cards, and The Big Bang Theory), read (I read everything from blogs to books, currently in love with Quora), and hang out with friends.
					<br><br>
					If you want to reach out to me, feel free to email me at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;to=jayendra@ucla.edu&amp;tf=1" target="_blank">jayendra@ucla.edu</a>
